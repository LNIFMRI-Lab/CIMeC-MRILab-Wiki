Best Practices
===============

General Guidelines
---------------
  - Export all data from the Stim-PC at the end of the experiment.

  - Backup copies of the researcher's scripts are recommended, as the preservation of scripts and data generated on the Stim-PC is not guaranteed.

  - Ensure that the physiodata are exported at the conclusion of the experiment.

  - Bring a USB drive for copying the data.

Stim-PC Organization
----------------
  - All scripts must be copied into the folder located at <PATH ON STIM-PC>, which is dedicated to your specific project. This folder will be prepared by the staff after the approval from the Ethics Committee.

  - Make sure that the output files generated by the experiments are saved exclusively in the folder dedicated to your project.

Behavior
----------
  - Do not consume food or beverages in the experimental area, which includes the Stim-PC area, desks designated for research staff, technical staff desks, and the MRI console. There are designated areas in the reception and the break rooms in Building 10.

  - Access to the area is granted only via intercom to personnel who meet the specified requirements, as outlined HERE <link access rules>.

Subject Training
-----------
  - If a pre-scan training session is required, the researcher and participant can use Room I-48, which is available at the lab's reception. The room can be freely accessed upon request during the laboratory's opening hours.

Phantom Sessions
----------------
  - A secondary Stim-PC with same specs to the primary one located in the experimental area is available for the preliminary stages of paradigm development, debugging, and testing.

Access to this platform can be granted in the following ways:

  - Remote desktop access
  - Physical access on-site

In both cases, access must be requested by reserving a slot via Google Calendar <insert calendar address> <link to "How To" instructions page>.
