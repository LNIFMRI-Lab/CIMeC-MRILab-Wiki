Best Practices
===============

General Guidelines
---------------
  - Bring a USB drive for copying the data.

  - Export all data from the Stim-PC at the end of the experiment.

  - Backup copies of the researcher's scripts are recommended, as the preservation of scripts and data generated on the Stim-PC is not guaranteed.

  - Ensure that the physiodata are exported at the conclusion of the experiment, as the preservation of the physiodata generated on the MR Scanner is not guaranteed.

In-Lab Behavior
----------
  - Do not consume food or beverages in the experimental area, which includes the Stim-PC area, desks designated for research staff, technical staff desks, and the MRI console. There are designated areas in the reception and the break rooms in Building 10.

  - Access to the area is granted only via intercom to personnel who meet the specified requirements, as outlined in `Access Rules <https://cimec-mrilab-wiki.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/accessrules.html#access-rules>`_.

MRI Project & experiments
----------
In order to start a study in the MRI Facility, all criteria for accessing the CIMeC facility (`Access Rules <https://cimec-mrilab-wiki.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/accessrules.html#access-rules>`_) must be met.

In addition, before submitting the project proposal (PPM) to the `Research Ethics Committee <https://www.unitn.it/en/ricerca/1755/research-ethics-committee>`_, the researcher must present it to the Lab Manager (FM), ER and MR. The guidelines for the PPM presentation are available in writing <insert link>. The PPM assesses the project's feasibility from the perspective of safety and organisational impact on the Facility.

The researchers with granted access to the MRI Lab must therefore be part of a project approved by the Research Ethics Committee and which is active at the time of booking.

Once the project is active (after the start date, as relayed by the PI to the Research Ethics Committee), the researcher must coordinate with the MRI Lab Staff to organise a trial run of the experiment at the MRI Lab (referred to as a `Phantom Session <https://cimec-mrilab-wiki.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/bestpractices.html#phantom-sessions>`_, see section below).

Following successful completion of the Phantom Session, a trial session must be organised with a participant in the scanner (i.e., the `Human Pilot <https://cimec-mrilab-wiki.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/bestpractices.html#id4>`_).

Code Testing
----------------
The StimDev-PC is available for the preliminary stages of paradigm development, debugging, and testing. This PC is located in Room I-48 (see `Subject Training <https://cimec-mrilab-wiki.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/bestpractices.html#id3>`_ section in this page). 

Access to this platform can be granted in the following ways:

  - Remote desktop access (`How To <link>`_)
  - Physical access on-site  (`How To <link>`_)

In both cases, access must be requested by reserving a slot via Google Calendar:

.. note::

Stim-PC Organization
----------------
  - Researchers must come with their `Project Code <https://apps.cimec.unitn.it/cis/projects.php?lang=en>`_ (see the “Code” column).

  - Researchers log in by using the credentials noted on the monitor.

  - All scripts must be copied into the folder located at ``C:\Users\user\Desktop\Experiments\<project_code>``, which is dedicated to your specific project. This folder will be prepared by the staff after the approval from the Research Ethics Committee.

  - Make sure that the output files generated by the experiments are saved exclusively in the folder dedicated to your project.

  - Make sure to copy the output files generated by the experiments, as the preservation of scripts and output files on the Stim-PC is not guaranteed.

Phantom Sessions
---------
The purpose of Phantom Scans is for multiple purposes, including:
  * testing for freshly installed sequences
  * systematic Quality Control sessions
  * quantitative exploration of protocols
  * preparing an experimental setup to be used for human experiments, etc...
This is crucial to have a working experimental setup for the studies.

Phantom Scans will be scheduled whenever possible. Keep in mind that when the MR Lab is open for Human Scans, these will have priority.

The insterested investigator must request a slot in coordination with the `MR Lab Staff <https://cimec-mrilab-wiki.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/contacts.html>`_.

Subject Training
-----------
If a pre-scan training/testing session is required, the researcher and participant can use Room I-48 (see planimetry below), which is available at the Lab's reception. The room can be freely accessed upon request during the laboratory's opening hours.

Human Pilot
---------
The purpose of Human Pilot is for testing if the scan protocol and the experiment paradigms fits the need of the project.

The data generated from the Human Pilot can be useful to the validation of the scan protocol, before the actual experiment begins.

Human Pilots will be scheduled whenever possible.

The insterested investigator must request a slot in coordination with the `MR Lab Staff <https://cimec-mrilab-wiki.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/contacts.html>`_.

Human Scans
---------
Each PI of an approved project is asked periodically (e.g.: monthly, on the third week of the month; every quarter of...) for an update of their specific scan needs and constraints for the following month (email the `MR Lab Staff <https://cimec-mrilab-wiki.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/contacts.html>`_ for questions and requests).

The MR Lab `Booking System <https://apps.cimec.unitn.it/cis/calendar.php?lang=en>`_ is arranged considering scanner availability and priorities of all requests.

Open slots can be requested online directly on the `Booking System <https://apps.cimec.unitn.it/cis/calendar.php?lang=en>`_.

PIs are responsible for informing as soon as possible if they cannot use a scan slot allocated to them (email the staff, indicating the reasing why the slot cannot be used).

To conduct experiments involving Human Volunteer Subjects, it is mandatory to perform a medical history assessment to determine their compatibility with entering the MRI scanner. This assessment is conducted by the MRI staff via a phone interview.

Therefore, it is mandatory to provide the MRI Staff with the volunteers' informations (full name, phone number, email address, and ideally date of birth) no later than 12:00 PM on the day before the scheduled slot. If the slot is scheduled on a Monday, the informations must be sent by 12:00 PM on the preceding Friday. This ensures that the MRI staff has sufficient time to carry out this task.

.. warning::
  Researchers must consider that it is possible for a participant to be deemed **NOT ELIGIBLE** based on the assessment, in which case they will not be able to participate in the experiment.

The MRI Staff will ask the Volunteer Subject to sign the completed medical history form and a declaration regarding incidental findings upon their arrival at the MRI Lab to participate in the experiment.

.. warning::
  Participants must also bring a valid identification document, so their identity can be verified by the MRI Staff before signing the medical history.

Important
-------
.. warning::
  If the researcher who booked the MR Lab cannot attend the scanning session, for whatever reason:
  
        - They must remove the booking 3 days in advance. This will allow the staff to re-assign the slot in a proper way;
        - Otherwise, they will be requested to pay for scan time even if they did not use the scanner at all.
  
  In the unfortunate event of a slot cancellation, if MR Lab is somehow responsible (e.g.: scanner not working; staff members not avaiable), then the researcher will not be charged for scan time.
  
Lab practice suggests to pack researcher slots one after the other in single sessions made up of several participants. Inter-session intervals make it hard for the staff to arrange all the scan time requests throughout the researchers.
  
Should researchers have, within their project, more sources to pay scan time, please make them letting the staff know it. This is crucial to properly charge specific scan time to specific projects.
