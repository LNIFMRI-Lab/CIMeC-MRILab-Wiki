Facility Costs
===========
The Facility consist of an organic set of highly sophisticated scientific apparatus, equipment and dedicated and specialized personnel, fundamental elements for satisfying the increasingly specific, complex and current needs of research.

The data, analyzes and services provided by the Facility are used by the applicant for the purposes of research or production. In particular for the institutional activity, the Principal Investigators of the University require services in the context of research projects financed by external bodies (European Union, local bodies, National, International, Private Foundations...) for which they must then produce one reporting both on the scientific side and on the economic-financial side, justifying in a precise and punctual way the costs inherent to the project, supported with the financing obtained.

In order to be able to apply verifiable and admissable rated as costs for the various types of funding, the University of Trento has undertaken a cost analysis.
