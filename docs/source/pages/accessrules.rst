Access Rules
===========================
Regulation
----------
Access to the CIMeC's MRI Facility is regulated on two different levels. An MRI Lab safety course trains for both levels:
  * Researcher Level: guaranteed access to the MRI Lab, under the supervision of a member of the MRI Lab Staff, but no to the magnet room;
  * MRI Staff Level: autonomous access to the MRI Lab, including the magnet room.

For safety reasons, the facility is a controlled zone; researchers can only enter if accompanied by a member of the MRI Staff.

In the MRI Lab, experiments (human scans) can be carried out as long as the required healthcare staff are available (MRI Technician and, if applicable, a Radiologist to perform an examination) on working days, 8AM to 7PM (excluding public holidays or other days communicated by the MRI Staff).

Training
----------
Before accessing the MRI Lab, users must complete general safety training provided online by UniTN:
 * the “Health and Safety at Work Course - General” for teachers, researchers, research fellows or the "Health and Safety at Work Course - General for students" if you are a PhD or Master student. Provided by UniTN, the course has unlimited validity; once passed, the user must enter the result into CIMeC Laboratory Agenda and Research Accounting (`CLARA <https://apps.cimec.unitn.it/cis/projects.php>`_), by uploading the course-completion certificate;
 * the “Low risk” Safety Course for teachers, researchers, research fellows or the "Low risk for students" if you are a PhD or Master student. Provided by UniTN, certification is valid for 5 years; once passed, the user must enter the course-completion certificate into `CLARA <https://apps.cimec.unitn.it/cis/projects.php>`_;
 * “Regulation (GDPR)” Course and the specific module “Guidelines to Privacy and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) - RESEARCH MODULE". The courses are provided by UniTN; once passed, the course-completion certificates of both courses must be entered into `CLARA <https://apps.cimec.unitn.it/cis/projects.php>`_;
 * the “Covid-19” Course (not mandatory). Provided by UniTN, once passed, the result must be entered into `CLARA <https://apps.cimec.unitn.it/cis/projects.php>`_, by uploading course-completion certificate.

**All listed/required courses can be found** `here <https://didatticaonline.unitn.it/ateneo/>`_.

Users must also complete specific training delivered by MRI Staff, and in some cases, preventive medical screening.

Authorisation to access the MRI Lab
-----------
After completing general training, new users must complete the following steps:
 * complete MRI Safety Training (three-year validity), with passage entered into `CLARA <https://apps.cimec.unitn.it/cis/projects.php>`_ by the MRI Facility ER;
 * upload the approval by the UniTN `Research Ethics Committee <https://www.unitn.it/en/ricerca/1755/research-ethics-committee>`_ of the PI’s request for inclusion of the user as a “New Project Member”. The document is entered into `CLARA <https://apps.cimec.unitn.it/cis/projects.php>`_ by the centre administration;
 * reading and acceptance of the online laboratory booking procedure, self-declared by the user in `CLARA <https://apps.cimec.unitn.it/cis/projects.php>`_.
Once these steps have been completed, `CLARA <https://apps.cimec.unitn.it/cis/projects.php>`_ allows the researcher to access the `Booking System <https://apps.cimec.unitn.it/cis/calendar.php?lang=en>`_ (using UniTN credentials) and, thus, to access the laboratory.
For the three-year renewal of authorisation to access the MRI Lab, the researcher must carry out MRI Safety Course Retraining, and passing it must be entered into `CLARA <https://apps.cimec.unitn.it/cis/projects.php>`_ by the ER for another three years of validity.
Regardless of training, Bachelors/Master’s and other undergraduate students, as well as undergraduate trainees, can access the Lab only when accompanied by the researcher carrying out the experiment.
 * Max number of researchers/students that can enter the lab at the same time???

Annual authorisation to access the MRI Lab Magnet Room
-------------
If the researcher needs special access to not only the MRI Lab but also to take volunteers into the magnet room, the following is also required:
 * certificate of fitness to work in the Magnet Room, issued by the appointed physician for health at work; this authorisation is entered into `CLARA <https://apps.cimec.unitn.it/cis/projects.php>`_ by the ER (valid for one year).

For annual renewal of authorisation to access the Magnet Room, the researcher must:
 * renew the certificate of fitness to work in the Magnet Room, again issued by the appointed physician for health at work; again entered into `CLARA <https://apps.cimec.unitn.it/cis/projects.php>`_ by the ER (valid for one year).
