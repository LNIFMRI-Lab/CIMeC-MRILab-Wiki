Access Rules
===========================
Regulation

Access to the MRI Lab is granted after attending a Safety Course provided by the MRI Lab and under the supervision of a member of the MRI Lab Staff only. You will not have access to the MRI Room (Zone 4, see the .. image:: figures/MRI_Lab.png
  :width: 400
  :alt: Planimetry
for more info about Zones).

In the MRI Lab, experiments (Human Scans) can be carried out as long as the required healthcare staff are available (MRI Technician and, if applicable, a Radiologist to perform an experiment) on working days, 8AM to 7PM (excluding public holidays or other days communicated by the MRI Staff).

Training
----------
Before accessing the MRI Lab, users must complete general safety training provided online by UniTN:
 * the “Health and Safety at Work Course - General” for teachers, researchers, research fellows or the "Health and Safety at Work Course - General for students" if you are a PhD or Master student. Provided by UniTN, the course has unlimited validity; once passed, the user must enter the result into CIMeC Laboratory Agenda and Research Accounting (`CLARA <https://apps.cimec.unitn.it/cis/projects.php>`_), by uploading the course-completion certificate;
 * the “Low risk” Safety Course for teachers, researchers, research fellows or the "Low risk for students" if you are a PhD or Master student. Provided by UniTN, certification is valid for 5 years; once passed, the user must enter the course-completion certificate into `CLARA <https://apps.cimec.unitn.it/cis/projects.php>`_;
 * “Regulation (GDPR)” Course and the specific module “Guidelines to Privacy and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) - RESEARCH MODULE". The courses are provided by UniTN; once passed, the course-completion certificates of both courses must be entered into `CLARA <https://apps.cimec.unitn.it/cis/projects.php>`_;
 * the “Covid-19” Course (not mandatory). Provided by UniTN, once passed, the result must be entered into `CLARA <https://apps.cimec.unitn.it/cis/projects.php>`_, by uploading course-completion certificate.

**All listed/required courses can be found** `here <https://didatticaonline.unitn.it/ateneo/>`_.

Users must also complete specific training delivered by MRI Staff, and in some cases, preventive medical screening.

Authorisation to access the MRI Lab
-----------
After completing general training, new users must complete the following steps:
 * complete MRI Safety Training (three-year validity), with passage entered into `CLARA <https://apps.cimec.unitn.it/cis/projects.php>`_ by the MRI Facility ER;
 * upload the approval by the UniTN `Research Ethics Committee <https://www.unitn.it/en/ricerca/1755/research-ethics-committee>`_ of the PI’s request for inclusion of the user as a “New Project Member”. The document is entered into `CLARA <https://apps.cimec.unitn.it/cis/projects.php>`_ by the centre administration;
 * reading and acceptance of the online laboratory booking procedure, self-declared by the user in `CLARA <https://apps.cimec.unitn.it/cis/projects.php>`_.
Once these steps have been completed, `CLARA <https://apps.cimec.unitn.it/cis/projects.php>`_ allows the researcher to access the `Booking System <https://apps.cimec.unitn.it/cis/calendar.php?lang=en>`_ (using UniTN credentials) and, thus, to access the laboratory.
For the three-year renewal of authorisation to access the MRI Lab, the researcher must carry out MRI Safety Course Retraining, and passing it must be entered into `CLARA <https://apps.cimec.unitn.it/cis/projects.php>`_ by the ER for another three years of validity.
Regardless of training, Bachelors/Master’s and other undergraduate students, as well as undergraduate trainees, can access the Lab only when accompanied by the researcher carrying out the experiment.

.. warning::
  For safety reasons, a maximum number of three (3) researchers, students included, are allowed to access Zone 3.

Annual authorisation to access the MRI Room
-------------
If the researcher needs special access to not only the MRI Lab but also to take volunteers into the MRI Room, the following is also required:
 * certificate of fitness to work in the MRI Room, issued by the appointed physician for health at work; this authorisation is entered into `CLARA <https://apps.cimec.unitn.it/cis/projects.php>`_ by the ER (valid for one year).

For annual renewal of authorisation to access the MRI Room, the researcher must:
 * renew the certificate of fitness to work in the MRI Room, again issued by the appointed physician for health at work; again entered into `CLARA <https://apps.cimec.unitn.it/cis/projects.php>`_ by the ER (valid for one year).
