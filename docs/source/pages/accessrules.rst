Access Rules
===========================

Access to the CIMeC's MRI Facility is regulated on two different access levels. The safety course for accesso to the MRI laboratory trains for both levels:
  * Researcher Level: guaranteed access to the MRI Lab, under the supervision of a member of the MRI Lab Staff, but no to the magnet room;
  * MRI Team Level: autonomous accesso to the MRI Lab, including to the magnet room.

For safety reasons, the facility is a controll-access zone; researcher can only enter if accompanied by a member of the MRI Staff.

In the Facility, experiments (human scans) can be carried out as long as the required healthcare staff are avaiable (MRI Tech and, if applicable, a doctor to perform an examination) every week Monday to Friday, 8AM to 8PM.
When healthcare staff is not present, usaers can access the Facility to prepare experiments and to define fMRI acquisition protocol to be used (phantom scans), but only when accompanied by a member of the MRI Staff.

Before accessing the Facility, users must complete general safety training provided online by UniTN:
